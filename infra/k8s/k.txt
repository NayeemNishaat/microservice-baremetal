# kubectl get nodes -> Get Nodes
# docker exec -it kind-control-plane bash -> Exec into the kind node
# crictl rmi <imageId> -> To remove the loaded image

# Important: When using kind we need to load the built image into the kind cluster -> kind load docker-image <image-name>
# Important: When using minikube we need to user the docker daemon with minikube -> eval $(minikube docker-env) and build the image in the same shell because the docker-env environment variable is set only to the current shell session. -> docker build -t <image-name> .

# kubectl rollout  restart deployment post-depl # Note: To restart the deployment
# kubectl logs post-depl-67f9548d9b-dw4vt # Note: To see the logs of the deployment
